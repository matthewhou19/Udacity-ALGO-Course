# Max and Min in a Unsorted Arra

## Analysis

1. Look for smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers.
2. The code should run in O(n) time.
3. We can traverse the array and track the min and max value of array.When we find an element large than the max, update the max. When we find an element small than the min, update the min.

## Complexity

Time complexty is O(N), because we only traverse the array once.

Space complexity is O(1). No extra space.
