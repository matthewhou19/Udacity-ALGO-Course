# Problem 3 : Huffman Coding

## Problem Analyzing

It is obvious that the key of the solution is to build a Priority Queue (PQ)to sort the Nodes. Since we need to insert Node to the PQ a lot of times , minHeap would be better than sorting the PQ for a lot of time.

So we  need to build a Node class and let it apply for heapq
